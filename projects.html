            <h4>Java</h4>
            <p>My first ever program coded in Java. It generates a random number then it moves upper and lower borders until it finds the number and counts how many times it has to move these borders until it finds the number. It's basically useless but I did learn a LOT on this project.</p>

            <h4>Batch</h4>
            <p>My first ever program EVER! People gotta start somewhere and i started programming with Batch. It was 2018 and I was in 8th grade. This project was a very bad attempt to make a multiple choice story game, but I did learn the absolute basics of programming on this. Unfortunately this project is lost to time :(</p>
