            Don‚Äôt worry about it. The deadline is in a week. You have enough time to play Valorant. You still got 3 days
            ‚Ä¶
            just watch some YouTube videos about ants or something. OH SHIT OH FUCK I HAD SIX MONTHS TO DO THIS AND THE
            DEADLINE IS TOMORROW!
        </p>
        <h4>Personal experience</h4>
        <p>
            Procrastination is something that I do very often. No matter how important the thing that I have to do is,
            there‚Äôs always something I can occupy myself with. For example, I am in my final year of high school and we
            have
            a ‚Äúgraduation project‚Äù to do which consists of two parts. The first part is the ‚Äúmake it‚Äù part, which is
            incredibly fun (Which I‚Äôve completed). The other one is ‚Äúwrite 4200 words of technical documentation‚Äù and I
            don‚Äôt want to do it at all (I did start but it took me 2 hours to write the abstract). I plan to leave it
            until
            I have maybe two weeks until the deadline and then pull a no-sleep week to complete it.
        </p>
        <h4>Effort from pressure</h4>
        <p>
            After you finally kick the procrastination monkey in the ass and take control again you will combine all the
            stress, caffeine, and restless nights into your most productive moments. The last moment motivation can lead
            to
            some pretty wild results and in my opinion, it can have plenty of benefits. Under pressure and with high
            amounts
            of stress you can hyperfocus on the thing that you have to do. No more distractions and just pure work.
            Resting heart rate? 140BPM. Chance of collapse? High. Will you do it again? Yes.
        </p>
        <h4>Uncontrolled procrastination</h4>
        <p>
            What will happen if you kick the monkey, it fights back AND wins? The ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù moment will never come, and
            you will just watch another ten hours of TikTok. When you get into this stage of procrastination I would
            recommend getting help from a professional and getting that Adderall prescription. I never took it, but it
            might help you. But how does Adderall work? It adds fuel to the fire that makes you lazy. Adderall is a salt
            version of amphetamine which increases the dopamine in your neurotransmitters. This makes you enjoy the work
            that you do. A lot of people take this drug just to make themselves more productive even if they can
            function normally without it.
        <div class="note small">
            NOTE: This happened to me a lot in the past five years and that‚Äôs why my grades look how they do. There‚Äôs no
            one other to blame than me. (I am not diagnosed with ADD or ADHD, I‚Äôm just lazy)

        <h4>Laziness of Ancient greeks</h4>
        <p>
            Sitting and doing nothing unless you absolutely must is not a plague of the modern era how many make it
            seem. It‚Äôs been around since forever! The ancient Greeks and Romans have thought very highly of
            procrastination. Maybe that‚Äôs why their economy nowadays looks how it does. Greece and Italy have a very
            high <a target="_blank" href="https://tradingeconomics.com/country-list/government-debt-to-gdp?continent=europe"> national debt to GDP</a> ratio. Italy takes the second spot with ratio of 155, but that‚Äôs nothing compared
            to Greece‚Äôs 193.

        <h4>TED Talk</h4>
        <p>
            I found this TED talk about procrastination and it‚Äôs pretty good. I recommend watching it.
