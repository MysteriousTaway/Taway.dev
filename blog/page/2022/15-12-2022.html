            <h2>The Inadequacy of Modern Education</h2>
            <h3>15.12.2022</h3>
        </div>

        <p>
            In this blog post, I will share my thoughts on how the current education system does not adequately prepare
            students for the rapidly changing and developing society we live in, and how being stuck in outdated
            teaching methods can hinder the development of skills in young people.
        </p>
        <h4>My Personal Experience</h4>
        <p>
            I have never been a fan of the education system. It has failed me in many ways, such as making me dislike
            the subjects I was forced to study. For example, since elementary school, I have been required to
            participate in physical education, but the teachers made me hate it so much that I no longer enjoy it. It is
            ridiculous to expect students to enjoy activities they don't like and then be expected to get good grades in
            those subjects.
        </p>
        <h4>The Pressure to Achieve High Grades</h4>
        <p>
            Our families, teachers, friends, and society as a whole expect everyone to be a straight-A student or, at
            the very least, to get Bs. Anything below that is seen as a failure. This is extremely damaging to students,
            both emotionally and physically. Staying up all night, cramming our brains with information that we will
            soon forget is not something I, or anyone else, would enjoy.
        </p>
        <h4>The Difference Between Studying and Learning</h4>
        <p>
            Have you ever noticed that the word "learning" has been replaced by the word "studying"? Many people think
            they mean the same thing, but that is not true at all. In the short term, they may be similar, but not in
            the long term. To learn something means, at least to me, to remember a piece of information that you will
            use in the future or are using right away. Studying is something like learning, but it is also not at all.
            It basically means to remember a piece of information, take a test, and then forget what you "learned." In
            my opinion, this is meaningless, and the time spent preparing could be better spent elsewhere, benefiting
            the student more.
        </p>
        <h4>No Time for Passion and Self-Improvement</h4>
        <p>
            Unless you are someone who can remember everything said in your classes, you, like most other students, have
            to spend a lot of your free time studying just to pass your classes. This approach to education leaves no
            time for students to develop skills that they are passionate about. Just imagine a world where students
            could improve in areas they are passionate about. In my opinion, this would be heaven. I am just one of many
            people with this philosophy. The person who inspired me was <a target=”_blank”
                href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Montessori> Maria Montessori </a> , who created a hands-on,
            real-world skills-oriented approach to learning. Unfortunately, the <a target=”_blank”
                href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori_education> Montessori education </a> system is not as
            widespread as I would personally like it to be.
        </p>
        <h4>The Lack of Modernism in "Modern" Education</h4>
        <p>
            Education was first made mandatory in the Holy Roman Empire (Germany, 1592) by the Protestant Duchy of
            Pfalz-Zweibrücken. Even back then, it was one room with many students and one teacher, used to teach
            children how to read and write. These skills are, and were, extremely necessary, and one cannot really live
            in society without them. However, have you noticed that the idea of a school and how to teach children has
            not changed in over 400 years? Back then, people did not know anything about human psychology or how kids
            should learn. Why have we been doing the same thing for 400 years when society and the world we live in have
            changed so dramatically? School teaches us to be obedient and do what we are told without questioning it,
            but modern employers are looking for people who can communicate their ideas and contribute more to the
            company than just physical labor. Not all employers, but those who want us to work in white collar
            positions, our parents and grandparents want us to work at, do.
        </p>
        <h4>A Few Final Words</h4>
        <p>
            As you can see, I am someone who would love to live in a utopia or, at the very least, in a world with a
            much better education system. However, as always, my ideas will be dismissed as "nonsense" by my peers who
            would rather do nothing and let the education system rot, rather than acknowledging that something is deeply
            wrong and proposing new ideas for how to fix these issues.
