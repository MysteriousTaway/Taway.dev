            <h2>The failure of modern education</h2>
            <h3>15.12.2022</h3>
        </div>

        <p>
            In this blog post I will share my opinion on how the “modern” education system does not reflect our rapidly
            changing and developing society and how being stuck in the dark ages of education can harm the development
            of skills present in young people.
        </p>
        <h4> Personal experience </h4>
        <p>
            I have never been a big fan of our education system. It has failed me in many ways such as making me hate
            everything that it teaches. Since elementary school I was forced to be a part of physical education and the
            teachers made me hate it so much. Being expected to enjoy activities that I don’t like and then have good
            grades in these subjects is ridiculous and that brings me to my first point.
        </p>
        <h4> Pressure to score high </h4>
        <p>
            Our families, teachers, friends and our society as a whole expect everyone to be straight A student or at
            worst get Bs. Anything below is seen as failure. This is very emotionally and physically damaging to us
            students. Staying up all night, filling our brain with useless information only to write it on a piece of
            paper and then forgetting it is not something I or anyone else would enjoy.
        </p>
        <h4> Studying is not learning</h4>
        <p>
            Have you ever noticed that the word “learning” got quickly replaced by the word “studying”? A lot of people
            think they mean the same but that’s not true at all. Yes they are similar in the short term but not in the
            long term. To learn something means (at least to me) to remember a piece of information that you will use in
            the future or are using right away. Studying is something like learning, but also not at all. It basically
            means to remember a piece of information, fill out a test and forgetting what you “learned”. In my opinion
            this is meaningless and the time preparing could be spent elsewhere which would be more beneficial to the
            student.
        </p>
        <h4> No room for passion and self-improvement </h4>
        <p>
            Unless you are someone who can remember everything said in your classes then you as most other students have
            to spend a lot of your free time studying just to pass your classes. This approach to education leaves you
            with no time to develop skills that you yourself are passionate about. Just imagine the world where students
            could improve in areas they are passionate about. In my opinion this would be heaven. I am just one of many
            people with this philosophy. The person that inspired me was <a target=”_blank”
                href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Montessori> Maria Montessori </a> who created the philosophy of
            hands-on and real-world skills oriented approach to learning. Unfortunately the <a target=”_blank”
                href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori_education> Montessori education </a> system is not
            wide-spread as I personally would like.
        </p>
        <h4>The non-modernism of “modern” education</h4>
        <p>
            Education has been firstly made mandatory in the Holy Roman empire (Germany 1592) by the Protestant Duchy of
            Pfalz-Zweibrücken. Even back then it was one room with a lot of students and one teacher. As you could
            imagine it was used to teach children how to read and write. I admit these skills were and still are
            extremely necessary, and one can’t really live in a society without them. But did you notice that the idea
            of a school and how to teach children did not change in over 400 years? Back then people did not know
            anything about human psychology or how kids should learn. Why are we doing the same thing for 400 f#cking
            years when the society and the world we live in has changed so dramatically? School teaches us to shut up
            and do what we’re told without questioning it, but modern employers are looking for people who can
            communicate their ideas with others and can provide much more to the company other than physical labour.
            Okay not all employers, but white collar positions our parents and grandparents wants us to work at do.
        </p>
        <h4>A few words at the end</h4>
        <p>
            As you could see I am someone who would love to live in an utopia or at least in a world with much better
            education system. Well as always my ideas will be called “copium” by my peers who would rather do nothing
            and let our education system rot, instead of expressing that there’s something deeply wrong and proposing
            new ideas how to fix these issues.
