        <p>
            The internet era of our childhoods is long gone. Back in the day most if not all websites looked simple and
            even our operating systems felt like home. Nowadays everything feels like an office building. Clean and
            efficiency-oriented design with simple shapes and color palettes is dominating the interwebs.
        </p>
        <h4> Simply modern assistant </h4>
        <p>
            Back in the day when you opened the file browser a friendly dog called <a target=”_blank”
                href=https://the-microsoft-windows-xp.fandom.com/wiki/Rover>Rover</a> would accompany you on your
            journey to discover the file you’re looking for. Rover was one of two virtual assistants waiting for you in
            Windows XP. The other one was <a target=”_blank”
                href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant>Clippit</a> (Clippy) who would help you while you
            were editing files in Microsoft Office. Both assistants had a quite complex visual design compared to modern
            <a target=”_blank” href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortana_(virtual_assistant)>Cortana</a>. Unfortunately
            design of virtual assistants reflects the prevalent design of its era.
        </p>
        <h4> Chaotic design of old web </h4>
        <p>
            Long time ago when Amazon was still selling books; websites looked so random. No design idea was off the
            table. Orange text on dark blue background, red text on lime green. Fifteen different fonts on one page, but
            most of it was written in comic sans anyways. Half of the page written in italic. It was truly the wild west
            of internet era, but each website had its own sense of personality. Nowadays all websites use the same fonts
            and design philosophies. Not only the corporate ones but also personal websites look like that. I tried to
            avoid this when I was designing this one, because I want this website to reflect myself as the creator and
            not how the corporate world wants me to present myself. I wish more people did this. We could bring back the
            good ol’ days.
        </p>
        <h4> Operating system of yesterday </h4>
        <p>
            As you might have noticed this page looks a little bit like Windows XP. I did this to remind you how good it
            was before and how different it is now. Even though this operating system was very insecure compared to its
            modern day counterpart it for many people holds a special place in their hearts. Fun fact about WinXP: You
            could download so called “Christmas fun pack” to completely overhaul your computer’s visuals by setting a
            red Christmas theme. This was much more easy to do on this version of Windows.
        </p>
        <h4>Happy nostalgia!</h4>
        <br>
        <h4 class=”note center”> NOTE: yes I am aware that my style of writing is chaotic but I write what I’m thinking
            about.</h4>
