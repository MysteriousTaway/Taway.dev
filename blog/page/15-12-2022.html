        <p>
            I had the idea of making my own website for a long time, but I never had the time or skills necessary to
            actually make it. After half a year of not having time for this I caught some lung sickness and had a week
            of free time to work on whatever I wanted instead of being stuck at school.
            <br><br>
            I fired up VS Code and began writing. First, I made the about me page then contact and then project list.
            The last page that had no content on it was the home page. I did not know what to add here for like a day or
            so. Then I saw <a target="_blank" href="https://www.andnixsh.com/">AndnixSH</a> and got inspired to write a
            blog.
            <br><br>
            This whole page is heavily inspired by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.zusier.xyz/">Zusier</a> from
            which I “borrowed” the CSS that makes those very cool looking lines. The rest is a mix of my own work and
            whatever I could find online (W3Schools). Believe it or not but I am really proud of this website and how it
            turned out. As a back-end developer I’m not good at making things look good but it turned out really well.
        </p>
        <h4>The English language</h4>
        <p>
            Also I would like to mention that I’m not from an English speaking country so I might make grammar mistakes
            or write sentences that make sense to me but not to others. Sometimes I do this so it's not an issue with
            English but rather with me being a dumbo.
